What is Ai agent?
sequence of action by using external tools 

agent = llm (for reasoning and decision making) + tools (for performing actions)

characterstics:
goal driven
planning 
tool using awareness
context aware 
adaptive -> readjust according the changes api fails, no data etc 



Types of Ai agents 

Design pattern for agents -> self ask with search 


1. ReAct -> reasoning + acting 
thought + action + obervation 
observation is the output of action (tools)

multi step process 
usgae of tools 


2. Agent and Agent Executer
Agent executer run the loop of thought, action and obervation 

AE send thought trace + user query to the agent
agent send action and action input to AE 
AE interacts with the tools not agent 


agent scratchpad is the memory of the agent 

3. Creating agent -> get user query and thought process to generate an action of final output -> if its an action it will again go to the agent executer
agent = create_react_agent(
    llm=model,
    prompt=react_prompt,
    tools=[tool]
)

4. agent executer ->loops, tool execution and get result 
agent_executor = AgentExecutor(
    agent=agent,
    tools=[tool],
    verbose=True,
)


5. Flow diagram 
query ->agent executer -> agent get the scratchpad(thought trace) -> generate thought -> either action or final output -> if its AgentAction -> execute tool -> result (observation) which update the agent scratch pad -> again to agent and this cycle repeats 
if its AgentFinish -> return return_values
